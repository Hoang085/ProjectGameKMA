	One Morning

1. Wake Up
- I woke up at 5:45 a.m. when the soft sound of birds reached my window.
- After turning off the alarm, I stretched my arms and legs to wake up my body.
- I opened the curtains and saw the sky slowly changing from dark blue to a gentle orange as the sun began to rise.
- The cool morning breeze made me feel fresh and ready for the day.

2. Morning Routine
- I brushed my teeth carefully, washed my face with cold water, and combed my hair neatly.
- I tidied my bed and organized my room to keep it clean and comfortable.
- For breakfast, I prepared a healthy meal of oatmeal, banana slices, and a warm cup of green tea.
- While eating, I talked with my family about our plans for the day.

3. Exercise and Fresh Air
- After breakfast, I changed into sports clothes and went jogging in the small park near my house.
- The park was peaceful, with fresh air, green trees, and the cheerful sound of birds.
- I ran three laps around the park and then spent ten minutes stretching to relax my muscles.
- I felt my heart beating faster but in a good, energetic way.

4. Learning and Preparation
- Around 7:30 a.m., I returned home, took a quick shower, and sat at my desk to review yesterday’s lessons.
- I read an English article about nature to improve my vocabulary and pronunciation.
- Then I checked my school bag, packed my notebooks, pens, and lunch box carefully so I wouldn’t forget anything.
- I also wrote a short to-do list to plan my study time and small tasks for the afternoon.

5. Reflection and Feeling
- While sipping a second cup of tea, I thought about my goals for the week and how to stay productive.
- The calm of the early morning helped me feel peaceful and focused.
- I felt grateful for the fresh start, full of energy and hope for a successful day ahead.
- This quiet, refreshing morning gave me the motivation to work hard and enjoy everything that would happen.
