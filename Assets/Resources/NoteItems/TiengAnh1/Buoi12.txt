- When we arrived, my grandparents welcomed us warmly with smiles and hugs.
- I helped my grandmother prepare lunch using fresh vegetables from her garden.
- In the afternoon, I walked around the village, waved at friendly neighbors, and played with some local children.
- I also took photos of buffalos walking slowly on the road and farmers harvesting rice.

4. Relaxation and Reflection
