- Daily convenience – smart devices, chatbots, and digital assistants support everyday life.

3. Challenges and risks
- Job displacement: automation may replace some human labor.
- Bias and fairness: AI systems may reflect existing social biases if trained on biased data.
- Privacy concerns: large-scale data collection raises ethical questions.
- Security threats: AI can be misused for cyberattacks or surveillance.

4. The future of AI in society
- AI will continue to expand in fields like transportation, education, and environmental protection.
- Governments and organizations need policies to regulate AI responsibly.
- Ethical guidelines are necessary to ensure AI serves humanity’s interests.

5. Conclusion
- AI is a double-edged sword: it brings tremendous opportunities but also serious challenges.
- The key lies in using AI wisely — maximizing benefits while minimizing risks — to create a more advanced, fair, and sustainable society.
