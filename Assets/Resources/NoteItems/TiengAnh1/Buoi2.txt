	An Afternoon at the Park

1. Introduction
- Yesterday, after finishing my schoolwork, I decided to spend the afternoon at the city park.
- The weather was warm but not too hot, with a soft breeze and a bright blue sky.
- I thought it was the perfect time to relax and enjoy nature.

2. Getting Ready
- I packed a small backpack with a bottle of water, some fruit, and a favorite book.
- I wore comfortable clothes and a hat to protect myself from the sun.
- Around 3:00 p.m., I left home and walked to the park, which is only ten minutes away.

3. Activities in the Park
- First, I took a slow walk along the path lined with tall green trees.
-I watched children playing games and people riding bicycles happily.
- After walking, I found a quiet bench near the lake and began to read my book.
- From time to time, I looked up to see ducks swimming and small fish jumping in the water.
- I also took some photos of flowers and the beautiful sunset starting to appear.

4. Relaxation and Reflection
- While sitting under the shade, I listened to the sound of leaves moving in the wind and birds singing.
- The peaceful atmosphere helped me forget the stress of homework and busy school days.
- I felt calm and thankful for the simple beauty around me.

5. Going Home
- Around 5:30 p.m., the sky turned orange and pink as the sun slowly went down.
- I packed my things, took one last look at the shining lake, and started walking back home.
- On the way, I bought a small cup of ice cream as a sweet treat for myself.

6. Feeling

- Spending time in the park gave me more energy and a clear mind for the next day.
