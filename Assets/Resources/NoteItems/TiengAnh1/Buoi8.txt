- Prioritize tasks – use methods like the Eisenhower Matrix (urgent vs. important).
- Create a daily schedule – allocate fixed study hours and breaks.
- Limit distractions – turn off notifications, study in a quiet place.
- Review regularly – reflect at the end of the day or week to adjust plans.

4. Benefits of good time management
